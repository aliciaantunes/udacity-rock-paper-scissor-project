# Al√≠cia's rock, paper, scissor project

The Rock Paper Scissors project is a game where players compete against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors. 
The program prompts the player for their choice and generates a random choice for the computer. 
The winner is determined based on the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. 
The program displays the choices and outcome, allowing the player to play again or exit. 
This project helps practice conditional statements, random number generation, and user input handling. 
It's a fun way to apply programming concepts and showcase coding skills.
